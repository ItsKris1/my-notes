## Project description
Notes web application under development.

This projects purpose is to get better at React while learning two new technologies(ones I havent worked with): TypeScript and Google's Firebase.

### Features
This project is not ready. 
I want to create at least CRUD functionalities for notes.


### Design
I made designs prototype in Figma. Some aspects of the design might change but I think I have a good base to start at.

Base design.
When you select an item by ticking the checkbox the create new note button will be replaced with two buttons "Select all" and "Delete".
